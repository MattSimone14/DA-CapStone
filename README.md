# DA-CapStone

Data Analysis CapStone Project

                                        PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project explores where it is safest to eat in Louisville by analyzing and comparing:
• Gun violence incidents
• Food inspection results
By merging these datasets, it will highlight areas where restaurants maintain high scores and are located in zones with fewer safety incidents. The goal is to help everyday people make smarter choices about where they eat.
